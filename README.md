# DTEK2072-Web-Programming-University-of-Turku

This repository contains my assignments and course project for the Web Programming course at the University of Turku.  
Solutions to course exercises are located in the `exercises` directory, while additional study projects can be found in the `studying` directory.

## Course Project

For the course project, we built a Weather App.  
A live demo is available here: [https://utu-weather-app.fly.dev/](https://utu-weather-app.fly.dev/)

Details about the tech stack and implementation can be found under the `course-project` directory.  
Refer to the respective `README.md` files in the backend and frontend folders for more information.
